Trotec

- Max. engraving speed 71 inch/sec. / 180 cm/sec. Standard
110 inch/sec / 280 cm/sec. Performance
Cutting speed depending on material, thickness, laser power

- For cutting applications with 45 W the use of the cutting table is absolutely necessary.

- PVC (polyvinyl chloride) must under no circumstances be processed with the laser.

- Windows only

- Check exhaust system

- During processing of commands the protection cover must only be opened after pressing the "Pause" button.

- Autofocus sensor. Used for the automatic focusing of the work piece (optional). Do NOT use this option when processing transparent materials.

- ON/OFF top-left and behind

- I was cutting my first keyboard prototype with 100% power and 1% speed, 2 traces per contour. Cutting has taken 12 min.

Usage

- IÃÅf all interlock-secured covers are closed, immediately after being switched on, the device starts the referencing process. When the referencing process is completed correctly, an acoustic signal sounds and the device is ready for operation. The readiness for operation is additionally displayed by green (slow) flashing of status display (9).

- An automatic move of the Z- axis can be stopped by pressing any of the positioning keys (1 or 2).

- Shift + Repeat = test laser source

- If you want to achieve very good results, when laser-cutting acrylic or wood, we recommend, that the plate be attached at least some millimeters above the engraving table. By doing this the smoke and the melting residuals underneath the plate can escape unhindered. A slight moistening of the plate will reduce the area of heat influence. Generally the protection foil should be removed, except when there is considerable development of fumes. During laser cutting the Hz setting (pulses per second) should be set to low, in particular for flammable materials.
